*Work-in-progress* Godot app of a simple game I would play as a kid similar to Crossword puzzles and Sudoku.
The idea of the app will be for the player to fill out a grid given a list of numbers such that each number can be found exactly once either horizontally or vertically on the board.
The player will also have a varying number of starting numbers already placed in the grid depending on the chosen difficulty.
